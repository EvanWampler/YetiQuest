# OOP Check List

## Abstraction  

Abstraction is providing a simple interface to something that has complexity behind it. Breaking a complex problem into
		smaller ones.  

	print("Hello World") uses many lines of code, but is simple.  


Our example would be something like game calling all the code that we need run, but not showing all the complex functions
		like "draw" is actually calling py.drawText("blah", 20,20,20,0)

	
	
## Polymorphism
The Actions class will use this for the execute method. Method overriding is the type.
	

## Encapsulation
	
Be sure to use _variables and _methods where appropriate for access control.
	

## Inheritance
	Entity(abstract)
		player / Enemy
	Service
		Vid/audio/keyboard
	Obsticle
		Wall/hole
